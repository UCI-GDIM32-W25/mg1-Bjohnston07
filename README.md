Where our plan breakdown for this minigame was similar to the end result was in the Player object & script. We said the player components would be the spriterenderer,
transform, and an implied player script. The main member variables for interaction would be the seed prefab and movement speed. The methods used would be Update() where
the movement would be. As well as a new method that will instantiate the prefab and if there is a change in the seed numbers, it would interact with a UI script to change the UI.
We also said the plant prefab wuold just be a spriterenderer and transform which turned out to be the case. For a UI controller script we said there would be member variables for 
the different text objects of seeds planted and remaining.
